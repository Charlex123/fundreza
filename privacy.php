We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

When we no longer need to use your information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take step to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it in accordance with our internal document retention policies.</p>
                          <p>When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by you or that you are provided with by us, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide you with if we delete some information about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.</p>

                          <strong>PRIVACY SHIELD</strong>
                          <p><strong>With respect to transfers from Europe, while the European Court of Justice has held that the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework is no longer “adequate” for the transfer of personal data from Europe to the USA, GoFundMe continues to abide by the privacy principles and other requirements of the Privacy Shield with respect to personal data we collect in the USA from data subjects in Europe. In addition, GoFundMe has implemented other appropriate cross-border transfer solutions, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to provide adequate protection for transfers of certain personal data from the EU to the USA.</strong></p>
                          <p>GoFundMe has certified with the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome"></a> as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Privacy Shield principles) from Europe. GoFundMe has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement for such personal data. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield list by clicking <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" style="color: #22a349">here</a>.</p>
                          <p>As required under the principles, when FundReza receives information under the Privacy Shield and then transfers it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on FundReza’s behalf, FundReza has certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) FundReza is responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
                          <p>If you have any questions or complaints about FundReza’s privacy practices, including questions related to the Privacy Shield, you can contact us at the email address or the postal address set forth under “Contacting FundReza”. We will work with you to resolve your issue.</p>
                          <p>If you are in Africa and are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns about our privacy practices, you can seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Privacy Shield independent recourse mechanism, the JAMS Privacy Shield Programme, which you can learn more about by visiting https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.</p>
                          <p>Residents of Europe can elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) contact GoFundMe and afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from GoFundMe’s designated independent recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the US Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. Each party shall be responsible for its own legal fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) can only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the individual. GoFundMe is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
